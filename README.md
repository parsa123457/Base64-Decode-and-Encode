Why? Because it's so weak, it's going to break down in a good way, and there are better options.

But it's very light and fast, and you can easily convert the sentence you want.
For someone who doesn't know exactly what a sentence means, it can take hours, but for a professional, it only takes 30 minutes.
But for someone to know what the sentence has become base64 it takes less than a second.
